    "Q1. What is an Exeption in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception in Python is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. It may be due to various reasons such as invalid input, division by zero, out of memory, or trying to access an undefined variable. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted, and the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed. Additionally, exceptions can be handled and resolved programmatically, while syntax errors must be fixed manually by the programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, the program terminates abruptly and generates a traceback, which is a detailed report of the error that occurred. The traceback provides information about the line of code where the error occurred, the type of error, and a description of the error."
