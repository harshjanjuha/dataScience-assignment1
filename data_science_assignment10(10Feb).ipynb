The \"with\" statement provides a convenient way to automatically clean up resources after they are used, whether or not an exception is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the \"with\" statement is used with the \"open()\" function, it ensures that the file being opened is properly closed after the block of code within the with statement is executed. This is important because if a file is not properly closed, it may result in data loss or corruption, and it may also prevent other programs from accessing the file."
